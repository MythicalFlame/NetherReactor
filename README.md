# NetherReactor

A better and rewritten version of the [original NetherReactor library](https://github.com/MythicalFlame/NetherReactorLegacy). Allows you to add custom items, effects, and statistics by injecting them into the registry.  

You can install a WIP [client mod](https://github.com/MythicalFlame/EnderReactor) to also register some features on the client side.  

Documentation is currently limited because the project is new and some things are not finalized. Documentation for statistics should be complete-ish though.
