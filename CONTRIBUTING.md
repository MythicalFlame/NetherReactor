# Contributing Guidelines
## Reporting bugs
1. Ensure you are on the latest version
2. Make sure the bug is reproduceable (provide steps)
3. If the issue is with item functionality, ensure that it is the fault of the SpigotModding framework (and not the code of the custom items plugin that has issues)
## Pull requests
> **_NOTE:_** We are not currently accepting PRs for new features. Only PRs that fix bugs will be allowed.
1. Make it clear in the title of your PR what the purpose is
2. Follow code conventions:
- Indent with tabs and not spaces
- Put braces on separate lines
- Use spaces in between `if` and `()`, but not `methodName` and `()`.
